# Bioinformática Decodificada: A Jornada do Iniciante à Genômica de Patógenos

**Decodified Bioinformatics: the beginner’s journey into pathogen genomics**

This is a learning-by-doing bilingual pilot approach in collaboration with Instituto Gonçalo Moniz FIOCRUZ-BA. In this initiative, the hosts and instructors work with the COG-Train education developers to deliver a bioinformatics course for beginners course in Portuguese. 

In this approach, administrative and organisational documentation is provided in both English and Portuguese, while the course is delivered in the native language of the Brazilian audience. 

**Topics**


The course will include the following topics:


* Basic concepts in pathogen genomics       
* Command line logic        
* Basic concepts of statistics for bioinformatics         
* How to obtain high-quality data and why it is important          
* Applications of bioinformatics in pathogen genomics           
* Critical assessment of available analysis tools and resources
