## About the course

In recent years pathogen genomics has proven to be a valuable tool to understand infectious disease dynamics and improve the epidemiology, surveillance and vaccine and treatment development for pathogens of public health relevance. One of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics' legacy is the expansion of pathogen genomics applications to tackle infectious diseases of public health relevance. This course will provide tools, discussion and resources to strengthen genomics surveillance approaches around the world. 


**Learning outcomes**

* Describe basic concepts of epidemiology and pathogen genomics          
* Identify key elements and tools to support a successful pathogen surveillance           
* Interpret and discuss scientific evidence to inform the public health system          
* Critique approaches used in global health surveillance          
* Describe principles and procedures for responsible public communication of pathogen genomics information            

**Target audience**

This course is designed for professionals from various disciplines who are interested in the implementation of genomic surveillance for pathogens of public health relevance and its impact on decision-making
