![](images/OC4_cover.jpeg)

## About the course

SARS-CoV-2 genomics surveillance has been proven pivotal for the management and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, genomics capacity is still limited, particularly in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). This course will provide tools and resources for capacity building aiming to strengthen the genomics surveillance approaches


**Learning outcomes**

* Compare sequencing methodologies
* Critically evaluate different approaches to determine SARS-CoV-2 genomes and variants
* Identify ways in which to scale up SARS-CoV-2 sequencing
* Describe SARS-CoV-2 analysis pipelines         

**Target audience**

This course is designed for diagnostic and healthcare professionals, researchers, and anyone involved in the testing and analysis of COVID-19 samples.
