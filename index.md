# COG-Train Resources Repository

COG-Train was a partnership between Wellcome Connecting Science and COG-UK to provide open-access learning in SARS-CoV-2 genomics. The programme run between June 2021 and December 2023. 

Working with our international partners and scientific leaders from around the world, the COG-Train programme delivered a series of free courses focusing on the SARS-CoV-2 genomics and bioinformatics.

# Virtual Courses

Viral Genomics and Bioinformatics virtual courses were delivered to participants in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Along with gaining bioinformatics knowledge, the participants also gained an opportunity to establish links and networks and develop future collaborative projects. In this repository, we collated the course materials from both courses:

* [Viral Genomics and Bioinformatics Asia 2022](https://wcscourses.github.io/COG-Train_Resources/vbioinfasia.html)              
* [Viral Genomics and Bioinformatics LAC 2022](https://wcscourses.github.io/COG-Train_Resources/vbioinflac.html)         

# Online courses

In collaboration with the digital social learning platform [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/), COG-Train delivered five massive open online courses (MOOCs) which together reached over 14,000 learners from almost 140 countries. In this repository, you will find the relevant course materials of the courses:

* [The power of genomics to understand the COVID-19 pandemics](https://wcscourses.github.io/COG-Train_Resources/power_of_genomics_home.html)        
* [From swab to server: testing, sequencing and sharing during a pandemic](https://wcscourses.github.io/COG-Train_Resources/swab_to_server_home.html)     
* [Making sense of genomic data: COVID-19 web-based bioinformatics](https://wcscourses.github.io/COG-Train_Resources/making_sense_home.html)       
* [A practical guide for SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing](https://wcscourses.github.io/COG-Train_Resources/practical_guide_home.html)              
* [Pathogen genomics: a new era in global health surveillance and strategy](https://wcscourses.github.io/COG-Train_Resources/pathogen_genomics_home.html)            

# Hybrid Courses

A blended, distributed classroom model was used to increase the reach and impact of the learning materials, with training being delivered simultaneously in multiple classrooms across many countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The distributed classrooms course materials can also be found in this repository:

* [SARS-CoV-2 Bioinformatics for Beginners](https://wcscourses.github.io/COG-Train_Resources/scvo2b4b.html)

# Train-the-training initiatives

The programme also featured ‘train-the-trainer’ initiatives, supporting researchers and healthcare professionals to learn about bioinformatics analysis and sequencing and acquire the knowledge to develop and deliver their own courses. 

In May 2023 we delivered an in-person training [Establishing Capacity for Pathogen Genomics Workshop](https://wcscourses.github.io/COG-Train_Resources/TtT.html#Establishing_Capacity_for_Pathogen_Genomics) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia with participants coming from 26 African nations. A follow-up seminar series will be programmed between September-October 2023 to strengthen the COG-Train alumni community. 	

We also piloted a bilingual English-Portuguese approach to develop a course in partnership with Institute Gonçalo Moniz FIOCRUZ-BA. The in-person course ‘[Bioinformática Decodificada: A Jornada do Iniciante à Genômica de Patógenos](https://wcscourses.github.io/COG-Train_Resources/TtT.html#Bioinform%C3%A1tica_Decodificada:_A_Jornada_do_Iniciante_%C3%A0_Gen%C3%B4mica_de_Pat%C3%B3genos)’ (Decodified Bioinformatics: the beginner’s journey into pathogen genomics) will be delivered in Portuguese between 30 October and 1 November 2023 in Salvador, Brazil.
