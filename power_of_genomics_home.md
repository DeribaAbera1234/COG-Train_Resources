# THE POWER OF GENOMICS TO UNDERSTAND THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

![](images/OC1_cover.jpeg)

## About the course

The world was devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Genomics is key to understanding and responding to the disease. This course, the first of a series of five, introduces key concepts in viral genomics and how they can be applied to the current pandemic. It explores lessons that can be applied to future pandemic preparedness.


**Learning outcomes**

* Describe how viruses cause diseases and pandemics         
* Discuss the use of sequence data for detecting and tracking the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants          
* Describe the development and action of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2       
* Evaluate the role of genomic epidemiology in pandemic decision-making       
* Explain how data sharing contributes to developing effective strategies against the pandemic         

**Target audience**

This course is designed for anyone interested in learning more about the genomics response to the current pandemic. While no prior knowledge about COVID-19 is required, it is likely to be most useful to researchers, healthcare professionals, science journalists, policymakers, and those working in public health.
