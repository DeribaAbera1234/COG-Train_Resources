## About the course


This workshop was hosted at the Ethiopian Public Health Insitute in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and took place on 7-12 May 2023. This in-person workshop consisted of lectures, workshops, knowledge exchange and networking, case studies, world café, individual and group projects and action settings. Over 30 research and healthcare professionals based in 26 African countries attended the workshop. 


The workshop was organised, funded and hosted by COG-Train (a collaboration between Wellcome Connecting Science and Cambridge University),  Africa Centres for Disease Control ([Africa CDC](https://africacdc.org/)) and the Ethiopian Public Health Institute ([EHPI](https://ephi.gov.et/)) and took place in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 7-12 May 2023.


This workshop aimed to empower African-based scientists and public health professionals to build capacity for pathogen genomics in research and service delivery in public health. The workshop focused on practical approaches and challenges in establishing genomics capacity, including sequencing and data infrastructure set-up, maintenance and resource management.  An overview of genomics and data analysis pipelines provided participants with a holistic picture from sample collection to interpretation. Participants also benefited from the experience of other experts in the communication of data to enable decision-making in a public health context.  


The tools and strategies developed at this workshop equipped participants with skills to design and develop their own training in pathogen genomics, further strengthening regional capacity, workforce and sustainability. A series of round table and panel discussions enabled participants to share knowledge and strategies for workforce planning, building sustainable models for sequencing and data science, and establishing consortia, networks and mentorship initiatives.


**Target audience**


Research and healthcare professionals based in Africa who are interested in implementing effective strategies for establishing and implementing pathogen genomics and surveillance capacity. Priority will be given to individuals in public health institutions who have started, or are planning to set up, infrastructure and data pipelines for pathogen genomics. Applicants must have some knowledge in genomics, clinical management or public health, and be interested in developing skills to train others.
