# Viral Genomics and Bioinformatics Latin America and the Caribbean


# Course Info

The Viral Genomics and Bioinformatics course taught participants how to analyse viral genome sequences and interpret genomic data obtained by high-throughput sequencing. The use of the command line to analyse viral NGS data, quality control of sequences, reference mapping and de novo assembly of viral genomes, pathogen identification from metagenomics data, and creating phylogenetic trees was covered in the course. Participants, along with gaining bioinformatics knowledge, gained an opportunity to establish links and networks and develop future collaborative projects.
