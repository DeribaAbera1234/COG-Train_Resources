# Making sense of genomic data: COVID-19 web-based bioinformatics

![](images/OC3_cover.jpeg)

## About the course

Over the past decade, sequencing technologies have become more accessible and sequencing data has increased exponentially, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, bioinformatics capacity is still limited. This course will provide concepts and tools for web-based SARS-CoV-2 analyses, aiming to mitigate the bottleneck on sequencing analyses.


**Learning outcomes**

* Describe the SARS-CoV-2 viral genomic structure         
* Evaluate different sequence analysis outputs           
* Apply a basic analytical web-based pipeline            
* Examine how variant calling contributes to epidemiological inferences           

**Target audience**

This course is designed for diagnostic and healthcare professionals, researchers, and anyone involved in the testing and analysis of disease samples. It will also be advantageous to researchers specialising in web-based bioinformatics, diagnostics, diseases, or pandemics.
