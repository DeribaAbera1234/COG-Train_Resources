# From swab to server: testing, sequencing and sharing during a pandemic


## About the course

Sampling and testing are key to understanding where a disease is spreading. In the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of samples taken, analysed, tracked and shared have far surpassed any previous pandemic. This course follows the journey of a sample from the swab to the processed data used by experts in pandemic response. It discusses how to share data across teams and internationally, and the ethical and practical implications of using mass data on a pandemic scale.


**Learning outcomes**

* Outline the journey from sample collection, through PCR to sequencing and data linkage         
* Compare the different sample types and how sampling strategy affects test performance
* Explain the importance of linking genomic data to clinical and epidemiological data sets to address public health and scientific questions
* Identify and explore ethical, legal and social implications of data use and sharing

**Target audience**
This course is for researchers, healthcare and public health professionals, diagnostic professionals, or any person involved in testing and analysis of disease samples.
